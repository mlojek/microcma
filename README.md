# microcma
This is a fork of the official Python implementation of [CMA-ES](http://cma-es.github.io/) meant to be as light and concise as possible. For the sake of simplicity, everything that could be removed, was removed. Only the implementation of CMA-ES algorithm is left.

## why would you do that?
I found pycma to be hard to read. I decided to remove some dead code, remove docstrings spanning 100+ lines and add more typehinting and rename stuff to make it easier to understand.
